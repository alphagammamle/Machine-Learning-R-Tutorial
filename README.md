# Machine-Learning-R-Tutorial

This is an introduction to machine learning/ statistical learning in R. We will cover various common machine learning algorithms, such as regressions, trees, clustering and SVM. All those applications and examples will be performed using R packages instead of Python.

The codes used here are based on the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani for details.
